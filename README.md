Repo Man part I

I heard the word,
It's goin' all around town.
Looks like your latest toy gone an
Put you down.
Well it won't be long,
'Fore you come crawling on home.
Like some old dog with your tail on the ground.

I'm listenin' to your Beg and your Plead.
Don't fill my heart with no pity.
What makes you think I'm gonna take you back again,
I ain't your Repo Man.

Used to be,
Just you and me.
So young and in love,
Just like it was meant to be.
Well it didn't take long,
Fore' I begin to see,
That you got eyes for every man on the street.

I'm listenin' to your Beg and your Plead.
Don't fill my heart with no pity.
What makes you think I'm gonna take you back again,
I ain't your Repo Man.

It's like you think I got revolvin' doors on my house,
Like you can just come and go as you please.
I'm 'bout to do what your daddy shoulda done,
I'm gonna lay you right across my knee.

I work like a devil,
Every night and every day, 
Bustin' my back,
Just to make my pay.
Now where is your woman you ask,
'Cause, as they say, while the cat's away...

I'm listenin' to your Beg and your Plead.
Don't fill my heart with no pity.
What makes you think I'm gonna take you back again,
I ain't your Repo Man.
